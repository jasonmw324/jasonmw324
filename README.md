## Hey, I'm Jason 👋

I am a graduate student in the University of Georgia’s M.S. in Statistics program with a strong interest in applied statistics and data science. My experience includes applied analytics in the healthcare sector and census-based analysis as part of my capstone project, with a focus on translating data into clear, actionable insights.


Here are a few of my projects you can check out:
