## Hey, I'm Jason 👋

I am a graduate student in the University of Georgia’s M.S. in Statistics program with a strong interest in applied statistics and data science. My experience includes applied analytics in the healthcare sector and census-based analysis as part of my capstone project looking at housing burden in Georgia.

I previously worked as a business analyst intern at PDMI where I worked with business analysts and backend engineers to design a Call Center integration project reducing call handling time by ~15% for 40 agents. I also led a team of 4 as a part of my capstone project looking at housing burden in georgia and the variables associated with it. Additionally I have just started a role at the Statistical COnsulting Center at UGA where I will serve as an associate statistical consultant. I am pursuing opportunities in data science, analytics, and applied statistics that combine predictive modeling, statistical reasoning, and hands-on data analysis to deliver insights and inform decision-making across diverse domains. 

Here are a few of my projects you can check out:


- [Analyzing Housing Cost Burden in Georgia](https://github.com/jasonmw324/Analyzing-Housing-Cost-Burden-in-Georgia). Using ACS data for the U.S. Census buruea I Led a 4-person team analyzing the percent of houses in Georgia classified as cost burdened (spending 30% or more of their income on housing costs) and the variables that relate to it. We summarized our analysis and findings in a [report](https://github.com/jasonmw324/Analyzing-Housing-Cost-Burden-in-Georgia/blob/main/Cost_Burdened_Housing_Analysis_Report.pdf).
 
- [Georgia Bridge Condition Classification](https://github.com/jasonmw324/Bridge-Condition-Classification). Using publicly available data, I built a random forest classifier to classify the condition of bridges in Georgia, achieving 75% recall on the poorest-conditioned class, enabling targeted maintenance prioritization and data-driven infrastructure planning

- [Energy Sales Forecast](https://github.com/jasonmw324/Energy-Sales-Forecast). Using U.S. Energy Information Administration Data I forecasted energy sales using dual scenario SARIMA models one focusing on the increasing growth trend and one being a more conservative model tapping into historical trends more. The models recieved MAPE's of 2.8% and 4.6% respectively. A streamlit dashboard of the models can be found [here]()



Some other projects include a R-Shiny Name popularity app to look at name popularity trends over time, a mall customer segmentation project using K-Means clustering, and several others all accessible on my github.
